Gson Library
Dependency Injection with Constructor and Annotations like ( @Autowired and @Service || @Component )
Docker
MongoDB {for tasks API}
Postgres SQL {for user details holder}
Lombok Library (annotation Library that contains @AllArgsConstructor, @Data, etc.)
Create a database in mongoDB called "CategorizeMeDB"
Create an Interface for manage database & queries called TaskRepository.
Add some basic test cases in CategorizeMeApplication.java file.
Use @AllArgsConstructor to inject the taskRepository to the TaskService class. (without using @Autowired and Constructor Injection)
work with both Docker and localhost Mongodb servers including mongosh cmd ,Mongo Compass and mongoExpress.
connect postgresDB to application and added JPA repository to manage data
CommandLineRunner Bean for added sample values to database.
we have to set getters to the appropriate entity class t when we serialize the object.
